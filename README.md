# Image_Forgery_Detection_and_Localization_Deep_Learning
The rapid development of the Internet and multimedia technologies has aided the efficient storage and management of digital media. As a result, fast transmission and sharing, and processing of digital media resources have gradually become an indispensable part of many peopleâ€™s work and life. 
Undoubtedly such technological growth has made forging visual data relatively easy and realistic without leaving any obvious visual clues. The abuse of such tampered data can deceive the public and spread misinformation amongst the masses. 
Thus, image forensics must be used to authenticate and maintain the integrity of visual data. For this purpose, we propose a passive image forgery detection technique based on textural inconsistencies introduced in an image due to tampering. 
The textural patterns of images are extracted using the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) operator. Moreover, the proposed Image Forgery Detection Network (IFD-Net) uses a ResNet-50 model initialized with ImageNet weights to classify the images as forged or authentic. 
Experimental results show that the IFD-Net performs better than most of the other state-of-the-art image forgery detection methods it is compared with on the CASIA v2.0 dataset.
